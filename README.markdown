# Upload Plugin 2.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josegonzalez/upload.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josegonzalez/upload)


The Upload Plugin is an attempt to sanely upload files using techniques garnered packages such as [MeioUpload](http://github.com/jrbasso/MeioUpload) , [UploadPack](http://github.com/szajbus/uploadpack) and [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php).

## Background

Media Plugin is too complicated, and it was a PITA to merge the latest updates into MeioUpload, so here I am, building yet another upload plugin. I'll build another in a month and call it "YAUP".

## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x
* Imagick/GD PHP Extension (for Thumbnail Creation)
* PHP5
* Patience

## Installation

For CakePHP 1.3 support, please see the [1.3 branch](https://github.com/josegonzalez/upload/tree/1.3).

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [http://github.com/josegonzalez/upload/zipball/master](http://github.com/josegonzalez/upload/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `Upload`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

	git submodule add -b master git://github.com/josegonzalez/upload.git Plugin/Upload
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

_[GIT Clone]_

In your `Plugin` directory type:

	git clone -b master git://github.com/josegonzalez/upload.git Upload

### Imagick Support

To enable Imagick support, you need to have imagick installed:

    # Debian systems
    sudo apt-get install php-imagick

    # OS X Homebrew
    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew tap josegonzalez/homebrew-php
    brew install php54-imagick

    # From pecl
    pecl install imagick

If you cannot install imagick, please do not use imagick, and instead configure the plugin with `'thumbnailMethod'	=> 'php'` in your setup options.

### Enable plugin

In 2.0 you need to enable the plugin your `app/Config/bootstrap.php` file:

	CakePlugin::load('Upload');

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();`, then this is not necessary.

## Usage

	CREATE table users (
		id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
		username varchar(20) NOT NULL,
		photo varchar(255)
	);

	<?php
	class User extends AppModel {
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.Upload' => array(
				'photo'
			)
		);
	}

	<?php echo $this->Form->create('User', array('type' => 'file')); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.username'); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.photo', array('type' => 'file')); ?>
	<?php echo $this->Form->end(); ?>

Using the above setup, uploaded files cannot be deleted. To do so, a field must be added to store the directory of the file as follows:

	CREATE table users (
		`id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
		`username` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
		`photo` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
		`photo_dir` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	);

	<?php
	class User extends AppModel {
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.Upload' => array(
				'photo' => array(
					'fields' => array(
						'dir' => 'photo_dir'
					)
				)
			)
		);
	}

	<?php echo $this->Form->create('User', array('type' => 'file')); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.username'); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.photo', array('type' => 'file')); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.photo_dir', array('type' => 'hidden')); ?>
	<?php echo $this->Form->end(); ?>

Thumbnails are not automatically created. To do so, thumbnail sizes must be defined:
Note: by default thumbnails will be generated by imagick, if you want to use GD you need to set the thumbnailMethod attribute. Example: `'thumbnailMethod'	=> 'php'`.

	<?php
	class User extends AppModel {
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.Upload' => array(
				'photo' => array(
					'fields' => array(
						'dir' => 'photo_dir'
					),
					'thumbnailSizes' => array(
						'xvga' => '1024x768',
						'vga' => '640x480',
						'thumb' => '80x80'
					)
				)
			)
		);
	}

Multiple files can also be attached to a single record:

	<?php
	class User extends AppModel {
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.Upload' => array(
				'resume',
				'photo' => array(
					'fields' => array(
						'dir' => 'profile_dir'
					),
					'thumbnailSizes' => array(
						'xvga' => '1024x768',
						'vga' => '640x480',
						'thumb' => '80x80'
					)
				)
			)
		);
	}

### PDF Support

It is now possible to generate a thumbnail for the first page of a PDF file. (Only works with the `imagick` `thumbnailMethod`.)

Please read about the Behavior options for more details as to how to configure this plugin.

### Using a Polymorphic Attachment Model for File Storage

In some cases you will want to store multiple file uploads for a multiple models, but will not want to use multiple tables for some reason. For example, we might have a `Post` model that can have many images for a gallery, and a `Message` model that has many videos. In this case, we would use an `Attachment` model:

	Post hasMany Attachment

We could use the following database schema for the `Attachment` model:

	CREATE table attachments (
		`id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
		`model` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
		`foreign_key` int(11) NOT NULL,
		`name` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
		`attachment` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
		`dir` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
		`type` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
		`size` int(11) DEFAULT 0,
		`active` tinyint(1) DEFAULT 1,
		PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	);

Our attachment records would thus be able to have a name and be activated/de-activated on the fly. The schema is simply an example, and such functionality would need to be implemented within your application.

Once the `attachments` table has been created, we would create the following model:

	<?php
	class Attachment extends AppModel {
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.Upload' => array(
				'attachment' => array(
					'thumbnailSizes' => array(
						'xvga' => '1024x768',
						'vga' => '640x480',
						'thumb' => '80x80',
					),
				),
			),
		);

		public $belongsTo = array(
			'Post' => array(
				'className' => 'Post',
				'foreignKey' => 'foreign_key',
			),
			'Message' => array(
				'className' => 'Post',
				'foreignKey' => 'foreign_key',
			),
		);
	}

We would also need to present a valid counter-relationship in the `Post` model:

	<?php
	class Post extends AppModel {
		public $hasMany = array(
			'Image' => array(
				'className' => 'Attachment',
				'foreignKey' => 'foreign_key',
				'conditions' => array(
					'Attachment.model' => 'Post',
				),
			),
		);
	}

The key thing to note here is the `Post` model has some conditions on the relationship to the `Attachment` model, where the `Attachment.model` has to be `Post`. Remember to set the `model` field to `Post`, or whatever model it is you'd like to attach it to, otherwise you may get incorrect relationship results when performing find queries.

We would also need a similar relationship in our `Message` model:

	<?php
	class Message extends AppModel {
		public $hasMany = array(
			'Video' => array(
				'className' => 'Attachment',
				'foreignKey' => 'foreign_key',
				'conditions' => array(
					'Attachment.model' => 'Message',
				),
			),
		);
	}

Please note that this is not the only way to represent file uploads, but it is documented here for reference.

### Alternative Behaviors

The Upload plugin also comes with a `FileImport` behavior and a `FileGrabber` behavior.

#### FileImportBehavior

`FileImportBehavior` may be used to import files directly from the disk. This is useful in importing from a directory already on the filesystem.

#### FileGrabberBehavior

`FileGrabberBehavior` may be used to retrieve files from a remote http structure.

Attach on your model Upload.FileGrabber behaviors:

	<?php
	class User extends AppModel {
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.FileGrabber' => array('gravatar')
		);
	}

Add in your view the form:

	<?php echo $this->Form->create('User', array('type' => 'file')); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.username'); ?>
		<?php echo $this->Form->input('User.gravatar'); ?>
	<?php echo $this->Form->end(); ?>

Please note: FileGrabber input field does not need to have `'type' => 'file'` set as an option.

## Behavior options:

* `pathMethod`: The method to use for file paths. This is appended to the `path` option below
  * Default: (string) `primaryKey`
  * Options:
    * flat: Does not create a path for each record. Files are moved to the value of the 'path' option.
    * primaryKey: Path based upon the record's primaryKey is generated. Persists across a record update.
    * random: Random path is generated for each file upload. Does not persist across a record update.
    * randomCombined: Random path - with model id - is generated for each file upload. Does not persist across a record update.
* `path`: A path relative to the `APP_PATH`. Should end in `{DS}`
  * Default: (string) `'{ROOT}webroot{DS}files{DS}{model}{DS}{field}{DS}'`
  * Tokens:
    * {ROOT}: Replaced by a `rootDir` option
    * {DS}: Replaced by a `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`
    * {model}: Replaced by the Model Alias.
    * {field}: Replaced by the field name.
    * {primaryKey}: Replaced by the record primary key, when available. If used on a new record being created, will have undefined behavior.
    * {size}: Replaced by a zero-length string (the empty string) when used for the regular file upload path. Only available for resized thumbnails.
    * {geometry}: Replaced by a zero-length string (the empty string) when used for the regular file upload path. Only available for resized thumbnails.
* `fields`: An array of fields to use when uploading files
  * Default: (array) `array('dir' => 'dir', 'type' => 'type', 'size' => 'size')`
  * Options:
    * dir: Field to use for storing the directory
    * type: Field to use for storing the filetype
    * size: Field to use for storing the filesize
* `rootDir`: Root directory for moving images. Auto-prepended to `path` and `thumbnailPath` where necessary
  * Default (string) `ROOT . DS . APP_DIR . DS`
* `mimetypes`: Array of mimetypes to use for validation
  * Default: (array) empty
* `extensions`: Array of extensions to use for validation
  * Default: (array) empty
* `maxSize`: Max filesize in bytes for validation
  * Default: (int) `2097152`
* `minSize`: Minimum filesize in bytes for validation
  * Default: (int) `8`
* `maxHeight`: Maximum image height for validation
  * Default: (int) `0`
* `minHeight`: Minimum image height for validation

* `maxWidth`: Maximum image width for validation
  * Default: (int) `0`
* `minWidth`: Minimum image width for validation
  * Default: (int) `0`

  * Default: (boolean) `false`
* `thumbnails`: Whether to create thumbnails or not
  * Default: (boolean) `true`
* `thumbnailMethod`: The method to use for resizing thumbnails
  * Default: (string) `imagick`
  * Options:
    * imagick: Uses the PHP `imagick` extension to generate thumbnails
    * php: Uses the built-in PHP methods (`GD` extension) to generate thumbnails. Does not support BMP images.
* `thumbnailName`: Naming style for a thumbnail
  * Default: `NULL`
  * Note: The tokens `{size}` and `{filename}` are both valid for naming and will be auto-replaced with the actual terms.
  * Note: As well, the extension of the file will be automatically added.
  * Note: When left unspecified, will be set to `{size}_{filename}` or `{filename}_{size}` depending upon the value of `thumbnailPrefixStyle`
* `thumbnailPath`: A path relative to the `rootDir` where thumbnails will be saved. Should end in `{DS}`. If not set, thumbnails will be saved at `path`.
  * Default: `NULL`
  * Tokens:
    * {ROOT}: Replaced by a `rootDir` option
    * {DS}: Replaced by a `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`
    * {model}: Replaced by the Model Alias
    * {field}: Replaced by the field name
    * {size}: Replaced by the size key specified by a given `thumbnailSize`
    * {geometry}: Replaced by the geometry value specified by a given `thumbnailSize`
* `thumbnailPrefixStyle`: Whether to prefix or suffix the style onto thumbnails
  * Default: (boolean) `true` prefix the thumbnail
  * Note that this overrides `thumbnailName` when `thumbnailName` is not specified in your config
* `thumbnailQuality`: Quality of thumbnails that will be generated, on a scale of 0-100. Not supported gif images when using GD for image manipulation.
  * Default: (int) `75`
* `thumbnailSizes`: Array of thumbnail sizes, with the size-name mapping to a geometry
  * Default: (array) empty
* `thumbnailType`: Override the type of the generated thumbnail
  * Default: (mixed) `false` or `png` when the upload is a Media file
  * Options:
    * Any valid image type
* `mediaThumbnailType`: Override the type of the generated thumbnail for a non-image media (`pdfs`). Overrides `thumbnailType`
  * Default: (mixed) `png`
  * Options:
    * Any valid image type
* `saveDir`: Can be used to turn off saving the directory
  * Default: (boolean) `true`
  * Note: Because of the way in which the directory is saved, if you are using a `pathMethod` other than flat and you set `saveDir` to false, you may end up in situations where the file is in a location that you cannot predict. This is more of an issue for a `pathMethod` of `random` and `randomCombined` than `primaryKey`, but keep this in mind when fiddling with this option

## Thumbnail Sizes and Styles

Styles are the definition of thumbnails that will be generated for original image. You can define as many as you want.

	<?php
	class User extends AppModel {
		public $name = 'User';
		public $actsAs = array(
			'Upload.Upload' => array(
				'photo' => array(
					'thumbnailSizes' => array(
						'big' => '200x200',
						'small' => '120x120'
						'thumb' => '80x80'
					)
				)
			)
		);
	}


Styles only apply to images of the following types:

* image/bmp
* image/gif
* image/jpeg
* image/pjpeg
* image/png
* image/vnd.microsoft.icon
* image/x-icon

You can specify any of the following resize modes for your sizes:

* `100x80` - resize for best fit into these dimensions, with overlapping edges trimmed if original aspect ratio differs
* `[100x80]` - resize to fit these dimensions, with white banding if original aspect ratio differs
* `100w` - maintain original aspect ratio, resize to 100 pixels wide
* `80h` - maintain original aspect ratio, resize to 80 pixels high
* `80l` - maintain original aspect ratio, resize so that longest side is 80 pixels

## Validation rules

By default, no validation rules are attached to the model. One must explicitly attach each rule if needed. Rules not referring to PHP upload errors are configurable but fallback to the behavior configuration.

#### isUnderPhpSizeLimit
