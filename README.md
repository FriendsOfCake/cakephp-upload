# Upload Plugin

The Upload Plugin is an attempt to sanely upload files using techniques garnered from packages such as [MeioUpload](http://github.com/jrbasso/MeioUpload) and [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php).

See [this branch](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/cakephp-upload/tree/2.x) for CakePHP 2.x documentation.

See [this blog post](http://josediazgonzalez.com/2015/12/05/uploading-files-and-images/) for a tutorial on using the 3.x version.
