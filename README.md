# Upload Plugin 2.0 (v.1.3)

The Upload Plugin is an attempt to sanely upload files using techniques garnered from packages such as [MeioUpload](http://github.com/jrbasso/MeioUpload) , [UploadPack](http://github.com/szajbus/cakephp-uploadpack) and [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php).

## Background

Media Plugin is too complicated, and it was a PITA to merge the latest updates into MeioUpload, so here I am, building yet another upload plugin. I'll build another in a month and call it "YAUP".

## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x
* Imagick/GD PHP Extension (for thumbnail creation)
* PHP >= 5.4.0
* Patience

## Documentation
For documentation, please see [the docs](http://cakephp-upload.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
