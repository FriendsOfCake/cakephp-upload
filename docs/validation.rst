Validation
----------

By default, no validation rules are loaded or attached to the table. You must
explicitly load the validation provider(s) and attach each rule if needed.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plugin allows you to only load the validation rules that cover your needs.
At this point there are 3 validation providers:
    
    - UploadValidation (validation rules useful for any upload)
    - ImageValidation (validation rules specifically for images)
    - DefaultValidation (loads all of the above)
    
Since by default, no validation rules are loaded, you should start with that:

.. code:: php

    <?php
    
        $validator->provider('upload', \Josegonzalez\Upload\Validation\UploadValidation::class);
        // OR
        $validator->provider('upload', \Josegonzalez\Upload\Validation\ImageValidation::class);
        // OR
        $validator->provider('upload', \Josegonzalez\Upload\Validation\DefaultValidation::class);
        
    ?>
    
Afterwards, you can use its rules like:

.. code:: php

    <?php
    
        $validator->add('file', 'customName', [
            'rule' => 'nameOfTheRule', 
            'message' => 'yourErrorMessage', 
            'provider' => 'upload' 
        ]);
    
    ?>
    
It might come in handy to only use a validation rule when there actually is an uploaded file:

.. code:: php

    <?php
    
        $validator->add('file', 'customName', [
            'rule' => 'nameOfTheRule',
            'message' => 'yourErrorMessage',
            'provider' => 'upload',
            'on' => function($context) {
                return !empty($context['data']['file']) && $context['data']['file']['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK;
            }
        ]);
    
    ?>
