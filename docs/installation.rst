If you install your plugins via composer or bake you shouldnâ€™t need to configure class autoloading for your plugins.

Prior to 3.6.0, you should use ``Plugin::load()``:

You need to enable the plugin your ``config/bootstrap.php`` file:

.. code:: php

    <?php
    Plugin::load('Josegonzalez/Upload');

If you are already using ``Plugin::loadAll();``, then this is not
necessary.
